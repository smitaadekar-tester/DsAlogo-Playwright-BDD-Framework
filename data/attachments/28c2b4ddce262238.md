      - paragraph [ref=e21]: A Data structure is a way to store, organize, and manage information(or data) in a way that allows the programmer to easily access or modify the values in them.

      - paragraph [ref=e27]: An array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key.

      - heading "Linked List" [level=5] [ref=e32]
      - paragraph [ref=e33]: If we have frequent insertions and deletions, arrays may not be a good choice. There is another data structure called Linked List. Linked List is a data structure that consists of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence or a list.

      - heading "Stack" [level=5] [ref=e38]
      - paragraph [ref=e39]: If we need to organize some data like a stack, so that we will take out those on the top of the stack first, then we have Stack data Structure.

      - heading "Queue" [level=5] [ref=e44]
      - paragraph [ref=e45]: A queue is a linear data structure used to represent a linear list. It allows insertion of an element to be done at one end and deletion of an element to be performed at the other end.

      - heading "Tree" [level=5] [ref=e50]
      - paragraph [ref=e51]: The type of non-linear arrangement where a node is attached to one or more nodes directly beneath it, is a special type of graph known as tree. In this data structure, the top most node is called the root and the connections between nodes are called edges. Nodes that have no children are called leaf nodes and non-root and non-leaf nodes are called internal nodes.

      - heading "Graph" [level=5] [ref=e56]
      - paragraph [ref=e57]: Graphs are the most extensively used data structures. Some real-world applications are Google Maps, Google Search, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Netflix and many more. A graph is simply a collection of nodes with edges between them. Graphs can be either directed or undirected. Directed edges are like a one-way street, undirected edges are like a two-way street.
